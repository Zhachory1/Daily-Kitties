# Daily-Kitties
This program uses your Gmail account to send text messages to people of your choosing random kat pictures. You can attach this to a crontab to send them daily cat pictures. :)

I use the free [thecatapi.com](https://www.thecatapi.com) to grab the random picture, saves it to your local machine. Then, provided you have the number and carrier of the person, or people, you would like to send it to, it starts messaging your friends.

Make sure you change the gmail, passw, and users variables to what you desire.

###Enjoy!
